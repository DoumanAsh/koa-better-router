You may also be interested in [koa-rest-router][]. It uses this router for creating
powerful, flexible and RESTful APIs for enterprise easily!

## Highlights
- **production:** ready for and used in
- **foundation:** very simple core for building more powerful routers such as [koa-rest-router][]
- **composability:** group multiple routes and multiple routers - see [.groupRoutes](#grouproutes) and [.addRoutes](#addroutes)
- **flexibility:** multiple prefixes on same router
- **compatibility:** accepts both old and modern middlewares without deprecation messages
- **powerful:** multiple routers on same [koa][] app - even can combine multiple routers
- **light:** not poluting your router instance and app - see [.loadMethods](#loadmethods)
- **smart:** does only what you say it to do
- **small:** very small on dependencies - curated and only most needed
- **backward compatible:** works on koa v1 - use [.legacyMiddleware](#legacymiddleware)
- **maintainability:** very small, beautiful, maintainable and commented codebase
- **stability:** strict semantic versioning and very well documented
- **tested:** very well tested with 100% coverage
- **lovely:** ~500 downloads for the first 2 days
- **open:** love PRs for features, issues and recipes - [Contribute a recipe?](#contributing-recipes)

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](https://github.com/{%= repository %}/issues/new).  
Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io](https://www.codementor.io/tunnckocore?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_term=tunnckocore&utm_campaign=github) too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Contributing Recipes
Recipes are just different use cases, written in form of README in human language. Showing some "Pro Tips" and tricks, answering common questions and so on. They look like [tests](./test.js), but in more readable and understandable way for humans - mostly for beginners that not reads or understand enough the README or API and tests.

- They are in form of folders in the root [`recipes/`](./recipes) folder: for example `recipes/[short-meaningful-recipe-name]/`.
- In recipe folder should exist `README.md` file
- In recipe folder there may have actual js files, too. And should be working.
- The examples from the recipe README.md should also exist as separate `.js` files.
- Examples in recipe folder also should be working and actual.

It would be great if you follow these steps when you want to _fix, update or create_ a recipes. :sunglasses:

- Title for recipe idea should start with `[recipe]`: for example`[recipe] my awesome recipe`
- Title for new recipe (PR) should also start with `[recipe]`.
- Titles of Pull Requests or Issues for fixing/updating some existing recipes should start with `[recipe-fix]`.

It will help a lot, thanks in advance! :yum:

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
